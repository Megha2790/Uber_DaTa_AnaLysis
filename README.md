# Uber-Data-Analysis
A Python-based project that analyses Uber Pickups in New York City using libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc.

# Analysis
In this project, I have directly imported the Uber Dataset from Kaggle to Google Colab using Kaggle API without uploading it to the Google Colab platform.
I have analyzed how many rides were booked based on the TLC company base code, month, day, hour, and combinations of them in New York City. And also I have done a
Geo-Spatial analysis of rides booked in NYC on Sunday.

# Contents of the notebook

2. Number of trips in each month
3. Number of trips on each day
4. Number of trips at each hour
5. Number of trips taken at each hour in each month
6. Number of trips per month on different bases
### Heatmaps
7. Heatmap of trips on each day at each hour
8. Heatmap of trips in each month during each day
9. Heatmap of trips in each month based on weekday
10. Heatmap of trips during every month based of Base they were booked
11. Heatmap of trips on each day based on the Base they were booked
### Geo Spatial Analysis
12. Performing Geo-spatial analysis of the Uber rides taken on sunday of every week in every month.
## Conclusion
Drawing conclusions of our analysis.
